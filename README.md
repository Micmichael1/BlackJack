# BlackJack
A Non-GUI Python Blackjack Game
An Original First Python Project by Me

The Game:
  Each Player Start with credits of 1.000.000

  OBJECT OF THE GAME
  Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

  CARD VALUES/SCORING
  It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.

  BETTING
  Before the deal begins, each player places a bet, in chips, in front of them in the designated area. Minimum and maximum limits are established on the betting, there is no limit in the maximum amount of bet.
  
  BLACKJACK
  If a player's first two cards are an ace and a "ten-card" (a picture card or 10), giving a count of 21 in two cards, this is a natural or "blackjack." 
  
  If any player has a natural and the dealer does not, the dealer immediately pays that player one and a half times the amount of their bet.
  If a player's score is higher than dealer, the dealer pays the player one times the amount of their bet and it goes both ways.
